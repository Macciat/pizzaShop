      <h2>The Journey of <span class="highlight">Primo Pizza</span></h2>
      <p>
        Before the first store, before the sign was ever hung, there was only a small kitchen and a family that loved to cook. 
        What started as quiet evenings filled with laughter and the smell of rising dough slowly grew into a tradition. 
        Over the years, that tradition would carry the name <span class="highlight">Primo Pizza</span>.

          <h3>The Beginning</h3>
          <p>
            In 1998, inside a humble home kitchen, the Primo family began shaping what would become their legacy. 
            Night after night they experimented with flour, yeast, and patience until the dough came out just right; crisp on the outside, soft within. 
            The recipe was simple, but it carried a warmth that made everyone who tried it feel at home.

          <h3>Our First Store</h3>
          <p>
            After years of encouragement from friends and neighbors, the family decided to share their creation with the world. 
            In 2005, the first <span class="highlight">Primo Pizza</span> store opened its doors. 
            The scent of wood-fired dough and fresh basil drifted through the air as locals gathered inside. 
            There were no fancy signs or grand celebrations, only the promise of honest food and a welcoming table. 
            By evening, every seat was taken, and the dream that once lived in a small kitchen had finally taken shape.

            The brand grew, but its soul remained in the shared smiles and the aroma that filled each store.
