      <h2>Welcome to <span class="highlight">Primo Pizza</span></h2>
      <p>
        Every pizza has a beginning. Ours started in a family kitchen where the scent of baked dough and fresh herbs filled the air. 
        What began as a shared love for food became a lifelong craft. 
        At <span class="highlight">Primo Pizza</span>, we carry the same passion that shaped our first recipe and the same care that has guided us ever since.

    <h3>Our Philosophy</h3>
    <p>
      We believe that good food brings people together. 
      Each pizza is made by hand, with dough that rests patiently, sauces cooked slowly, and ingredients chosen for their freshness and honesty. 
      We hold to the idea that a meal should be more than food; it should be a moment to share and remember.

    <h3>Our Promise</h3>
    <p>
      Our promise is to stay true to where we began. 
      Every pizza that leaves our oven carries the same warmth, flavor, and care that filled our first kitchen. 
      Whether it’s enjoyed with family, shared among friends, or savored alone after a long day, 
      <span class="highlight">Primo Pizza</span> will always be about simple, honest food made with heart.
